# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification – CodSoft Internship (Task 2)

This project is part of my **CodSoft Data Science Internship** and focuses on building a machine learning model to classify **Iris flowers** into three species: *Setosa, Versicolor,* and *Virginica* based on their **sepal and petal measurements**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

- **Objective**: Predict the species of Iris flowers using machine learning.
- **Dataset**: [Kaggle - Iris Flower Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset)
- **Models Used**:
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)

---

## 📊 Key Features

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Seaborn & Matplotlib
- Model Training and Evaluation
- Performance Metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report
- **Cross-Validation (CV)** for robust model evaluation

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy

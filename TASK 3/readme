# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

![Project Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Completed-brightgreen)  
🚀 **Project Completed as part of CodSoft Internship**

This project uses real-world credit card transaction data to detect fraud using machine learning models like **Random Forest** and **XGBoost**. It includes **data preprocessing**, **model training**, **evaluation**, and **Streamlit deployment** for real-time fraud prediction.

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- **Rows**: 284,807 transactions
- **Fraud Cases**: 492 (~0.17%)
- **Features**: 30 (Time, Amount, V1–V28, Class)

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)
- Streamlit
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Pickle

## 🔧 Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values (if any)
   - Standardized features
   - Performed EDA & visualizations

2. **Class Imbalance Handling**
   - Applied **SMOTE** to oversample the minority (fraud) class

3. **Model Training**
   - Trained **XGBoost** and **Random Forest** models
   - Evaluated using **Confusion Matrix**, **F1-Score**, and **ROC-AUC**

4. **Model Saving**
   - Saved models using `pickle` for reuse

5. **Deployment**
   - Built an interactive UI with **Streamlit** for real-time fraud detection

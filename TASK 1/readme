# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction - CodSoft Internship Project

This is a machine learning project completed as part of the **CodSoft Internship**. The goal is to build a classification model that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using key features like age, gender, class, and fare.

## 📌 Project Objective

Predict passenger survival on the Titanic using supervised machine learning techniques. The model is trained on labeled data and evaluated for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Using the Titanic dataset, predict the `Survived` column (0 = No, 1 = Yes) based on features such as:
- Passenger Class (`Pclass`)
- Gender (`Sex`)
- Age
- Number of Siblings/Spouses (`SibSp`)
- Number of Parents/Children (`Parch`)
- Ticket Fare (`Fare`)
- Embarked Port (`Embarked`)

## 📂 Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset)
- Files used: `train.csv`

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Scikit-learn (for model building & evaluation)
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🔍 Workflow

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values (`Age`, `Embarked`, `Fare`)
- Removed unnecessary columns (`Name`, `Ticket`, `Cabin`, `PassengerID`)
- Label encoded and one-hot encoded categorical variables

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed survival rate by gender, class, age groups
- Visualized correlations and distributions

### 3. Model Building
- Trained two models:
  - **Logistic Regression** (baseline model)
  - **Random Forest Classifier** (final model)

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report
- Feature Importance (for Random Forest)

## 📈 Results

| Model                | Accuracy |
|---------------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 76%      |
| Random Forest       | 84% ✅    |

- Random Forest achieved higher accuracy and better generalization.
- Gender (`Sex`), Class (`Pclass`), and Fare were top predictors of survival.
